    // An alternative to locks is to use synchronized methods
    /* From the official documentation:
        Making methods synchronized has two effects:
            - First, it is not possible for two invocations of synchronized methods on the _same
              object_ to interleave. When one thread is executing a synchronized method for an
              object, all other threads that invoke synchronized methods _for the same object_
              block (suspend execution) until the first thread is done with the object.
            - Second, when a synchronized method exits, it automatically establishes a happens-before
              relationship with any subsequent invocation of a synchronized method for the same object.
              This guarantees that changes to the state of the object are visible to all threads.
        Note that constructors cannot be synchronized — using the synchronized keyword with a constructor
        is a syntax error. Synchronizing constructors doesn't make sense, because only the thread that
        creates an object should have access to it while it is being constructed.
