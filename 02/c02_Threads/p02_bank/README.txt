Task:

Create a class which will simulate the behaviour of a bank. The bank has N accounts opened for it's clients and
each account has some initial balance on it. Your task is to provide a mechanism to transfer currency from one
account to another. Test your class by calling multiple threads (simulating clients) which will transfer currency
between random accounts.

Note: Keep track of the total balance. Why does it change?

Fix: Try out different synchronization mechanisms on the transfer method.
